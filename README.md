## UX

While planning and taking in the principles of UX, planning how it will bring in the audience and future customers.

Samco Website Target audience:

* ages between 18 to 40
* Motor vehicle Enthusiast
* people who have an interest in motorsports
* Small companies looking to sell new products
  
What the clients will be looking for:

* Easy way to get information about the products and company
* Clear and high-quality Pictures of the products
* where they can get in contact and get news on new products
  
the plan is to hit all of these targets and keep improving and adapting.

the website is responsive to cover all bases because the age range we are aiming for the site covers both mobile to full-screen computers.

### Structure

the website is a three-page website with a nav bar to get around with ease. the first page covers the information with a picture to show a hose in use. All pages have all socials at the bottom of each page in the footer for ease of access.

the second page has a big gallery to show all different types of hoses, this also will have a few pictures with just the products so the clients can see what they will receive in the post.

the third page will have a sign-up form so they can receive new and product information and when you fill out the form fully the first name last name and email will be required and the three check boxes under will be up to the client.

### Scope

To help achieve our company goals the full deployment will have:

* Header and menu bar, to navigate all sections
* Information on the company and the products produced
* Videos of the production
* sign up page to get in contact with the clients
* downloadable catalog
* links to social media forms
* Newsletter sign-up form

### Surface

the colour scheme I choose was to match the Samco company and keep with their colour scheme

I also used Verdana font because it was nice and worked well with the site shape all the other fonts I tired just didn't feel right

### Features
The web page is fully responsive and desinged for mobile phones and then moved up through the screen sizes. the page is set out into sections to make it easier to read with header then nav bar, then main infomatiom and then footer.
### Nav bar

![](file:///workspaces/Samcohoses/docs/navbar-picture.png)

the nav bar i have made it so it shrinks and grows with the screen size. it also has only three sections at the moment.
### About

![](docs/about-page-infomation.png)

the main infomation moves with the screen size the bigger screens it moves to the middle to get rid of a big white space.
on small screens it makes the image float to the right and keeps inline with it.

### Gallery

![](docs/gallery.png)

the gallery also adjusts with the screen size and adds coloums depending on the screen sizes and keeps all the pictures form bluring or pixlelating.

### Sign up

![](docs/form.png)

the sign up page is there for customers to sign up for news, it also sends info about vehicles, Car bikes and other so it can filter what they have i have also made it so they do not require to click any so they just get all infomation insted of specsfic infomation.

### Submit Page

[](docs/submit-page.png)

the submit page has a little thank you message and a home button but it also has the nav bar so its down to the user what they press, in the future i would like to add more content to this page.

Problems

I tried multiple times to make a checkbox drop-down but just couldn't get it to work so I made the three tabs look good in all screen sizes and make sure they fit all.

code I used from other sources
I used the code from the social links at the bottom
Happy coding!
