Welcome
this is my first project about a compay i work for and and about there produscts they sell.
i choses to have a main page about the company and what they can do for the customers with links to all their socials. 

the second page is a resposive gallery so mobile and and computeres both get the best view possible and the third page is a sign up to a news and promotions like most websites.

Problems
i tried mulitply time to make a checkbox drop down but just couldnt get it to work so i made the three tabs look good in all screen sizes and make sure they fit all.

code i used from other sources 
i used the code from the social links at the bottom 
Happy coding!
