## UX

While planning and taking in the principles of UX, planning how it will bring in the audience and future customers.

Samco Website Target audience:

* ages between 18 to 40
* Motor vehicle Enthusiast
* people who have an interest in motorsports
* Small companies looking to sell new products
  
What the clients will be looking for:

* Easy way to get information about the products and company
* Clear and high-quality Pictures of the products
* where they can get in contact and get news on new products
  
the plan is to hit all of these targets and keep improving and adapting.

the website is responsive to cover all bases because the age range we are aiming for the site covers both mobile to full-screen computers.

### Structure

the website is a three-page website with a nav bar to get around with ease. the first page covers the information with a picture to show a hose in use. All pages have all socials at the bottom of each page in the footer for ease of access.

the second page has a big gallery to show all different types of hoses, this also will have a few pictures with just the products so the clients can see what they will receive in the post.

the third page will have a sign-up form so they can receive new and product information and when you fill out the form fully the first name last name and email will be required and the three check boxes under will be up to the client.

### Scope

To help achieve our company goals the full deployment will have:

* Header and menu bar, to navigate all sections
* Information on the company and the products produced
* Videos of the production
* sign up page to get in contact with the clients
* downloadable catalog
* links to social media forms
* Newsletter sign-up form

### Surface

the colour scheme I choose was to match the Samco company and keep with their colour scheme

I also used Verdana font because it was nice and worked well with the site shape all the other fonts I tired just didn't feel right

## Credits

Problems

I tried multiple times to make a checkbox drop-down but just couldn't get it to work so I made the three tabs look good in all screen sizes and make sure they fit all.

code I used from other sources
I used the code from the social links at the bottom
Happy coding!
